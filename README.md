# Crowd of Oz
This repository contains the implementation of Crowd of Oz (CoZ) -- a crowd powered conversational assistant for the Pepper robot. CoZ helps to recruits crowd-workers as tele-operators to control the social behaviors of the robot. CoZ achieves this by providing media rich interfaces to assist crowd-workers to contextualize the conversation and defining pavilion algorithm to sustain crowd workers by analyzing turnover conditions, e.g. when workers return, submit and abandon our task.
